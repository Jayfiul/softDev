Front-End is the framework
Bootstrap is the foundation

- There are many comonalities for foundation

Pros of a frontend framework:
- It makes life easier. Instead of writing all the CSS, you can say you want THAT box, I want a jumbotron for example. 
- All the css will be written for. You take advantage of existing css for you.

Cons:
- You lose freedom
- Your website looks similar to most other websites. 
- You are not always going to use all the CSS, so a lot of data is downloaded for no reason. It causes your app to almost be non-functional. 

CDN(Content Delivery Network):
- If there is a server that hoses all the bootstrap code. There is a problem because everyone is trying to get something from one place.
- A CDN mirrors that server at closer locations, which allow more people to connect easier. 

Just In Time:

Minimum:
- Gives you only the css you use, and the rest are whitespace.

Checklist:
- I just want a minum tooklit, it checks only the things needed and removes the rest.
