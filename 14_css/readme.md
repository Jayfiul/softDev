DISCOS:
- You can add "../" in the path in `href` to leave go higher up in the file hirearhcy 
- The HTML file still goes in `templates` but instead of the .css being in the same folder as the HTML it is put in `static` becuase it never changes. 
- You can simply just say `render_templates("index.html") and flask with host the HTML like how it would be if you manullay loaded it up.
