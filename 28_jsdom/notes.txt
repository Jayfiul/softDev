DISCO
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* In Dr.Racket you have to set the language in the top of the code
* You type out lambda
* You use `Node` to compile JavaScript code, so its Node *filename*.js
* If you want to print anything on the terminal, you have to have to do `console.log` and then the thing you
want to put in parenthese after that. 
=================================================================

QCC
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* How to compile Scheme code?
* It is hard to remember to put a semi colon after each line of code becuase we have used so much python
* Ctrl Shift K did work for me, but I just did Ctrl Shift I and looked at the console from there.
