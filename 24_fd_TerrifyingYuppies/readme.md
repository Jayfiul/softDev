### DISCOS:
- You can use foundatin to link twitter pages and youtube videos
- You can also use foundation in order to link a website, and when you click that button it takes you to that website
- 


### Q/C/C:
- Would we be able to use foundation and bootstrap together?
  - If we are would there be classes that occupy the same name?
    - If so what problems would arise?
- A concern was how would we implement cookies with foundation.
- I believe that foundation has more modern features, such as linking twitter and youtube, but bootstrap has more asthetic features, such as a carouslee and colors.
